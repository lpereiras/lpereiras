# Hi! My name is Lucas Pereira :wave:

Happy that you're here! This is where I have some showcase of my practical skills as a proactive QA Engineer! 
</br>
Right below are pinned some personal projects that I'm currently working with and since I don't want you to waiting for me finishing all the funny part like:

* Build independent Unit, Integration and E2E tests 
* Use design patterns to make code clear and easily maintainable
* Create randomized test mass for a more realiable automation
* Implementing pipelines with specific jobs and triggers
* Or develop automated tests based on manual validation to get through all edge cases  


I've antecipated a README file for each project that can guide you through what I already did! Really hope you like it!
